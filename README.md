A [BigInt] can represent whole numbers larger than 2‚Åµ¬≥ - 1 [(1)]. *ES2020*
introduced it as a built-in object. `BigInt` enables us to represent integers
with arbitrary precision, allowing us to perform mathematical operations on
large integers [(2)]. This package includes common bigint functions related to
querying **about** numbers, **comparing** numbers, performing **rounded
division**, performing **modulo** operations, **controlling range** of numbers,
performing **arithmetic** operations, obtaining **divisors** of a number (and
related operations), getting the number of possible **arrangements** of a set of
objects, performing **geometry**-related calculations, performing basic
**statistical** analysis, and finding various **statistical means**.

This package is available in *Node.js* and *Web* formats. The web format
is exposed as `extra_bigint` standalone variable and can be loaded from
[jsDelivr CDN].
